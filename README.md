Hi, I’m @Zuckerhuegel <br>
I’m currently studying Cybersecurity.. <br>
This is going to be collection of multiple repositories where I write about my progress and store some projects. <br>
Some parts may be public in the near future. Others not! <br>
I’m not looking to collaborate with others right now. 💞️ <br>
I do not have any interest in making money with this profile! 

Please consider that for my easier use most of my "projects" will be written in German. <br>
Enjoy!
